        <p id="topTitle">The Story of Adax</p>
            <p>Raymond Jeremy Harvey was born on June 25, 1973. He was raised by his grandparents, Milton & Lois. At a very young age,
            Ray took an interest in computers and started teaching himself how to use them and how to program them. Though his
            grandparents loved him and cared for him very much, he was rather sheltered as child and didn't have many friends. He
            was also very intelligent which, though that would be helpful later, didn't help gain a lot of "cool points" as a boy in
            school. Just like in the movies, the thin computer nerd carrying an inhaler archetype doesn't usually win many
            popularity contests. But, he was very good with his computer skills. In fact, it seemed to come almost naturally to him.
            And when he found out that computers could learn and be taught to do things, Ray decided he would try to essentially
            build himself a friend. So, when he was about 12 years old, Raymond Harvey conceived the idea of building, what later
            became, Adax. He spent hours upon hours working on his computers and programming skills. Not only was he young, but this
            was in the early days of computing. At this time, having a computer in the home was still the big "new thing" and still
            being questioned by a lot of the public about whether or not it would last, or simply be a passing fad. It was still
            new, and not as simple as today where we can just download a pre-packaged program and build from there. This was
            building from scratch. He taught himself programming with BASIC, and using PCs like Commadore-64, that most people now
            don't even remember. He learned anything he get his hands on. And in the process, slowly over the years, continued
            building his would-be friend.</p>

            <p>Eventually, Ray developed Alli. This was what you could call the first working version, or prototype, of what is now
            called Adax. In simple terms, Alli was based on programming that allowed computers to learn and respond to human
            language, or artificial language learning interface. Alli. This is where "she" started to become more of the "friend"
            idea that Ray had in mind growing up. You could tell her something, she would understand what you said, and she would
            respond. But she still wasn't exactly what she needed to be just yet. It is one thing to teach a computer to respond a
            certain way to a certain phrase or command. It is another thing entirely to have a conversation with one. During the
            process of all this, Ray would tell his friends and loved ones about his project. Some would even get involved to some
            extent. But over the years, he came in need for a name change; not only because she was growing and becoming a little
            more than what she was as Alli, such as working with artificial intelligence and natural language processing and
            databases, but also to go along with the times and possible future clients. That is partly because, eventually, she was
            given a voice. The voices come in both female and male. To Raymond and close friends and relatives who are near to the
            project, she will always be she. But, thanks to movies and media, a lot of people had trouble trusting a computer with a
            female voice. Think of "Terminator" where Skynet was female, or "Resident Evil" and the Red Queen. Some people associate
            female computer voices with dangerous AI. At the same time, some people associate the male voice with the more creepy
            computer vibes. Just look at "Demon seed" where Proteus has a male voice. And before that, even though it did not speak
            with a voice, "Colossus" was referred to as he. Not only this, but some people simply have a preference as to what
            sounds better to them. So it was necessary to make sure that she (the program) was able to have male or female voice.
            Therefore, she also needed a name that could be neutral. So, Adax was the new name chosen. Not only does it sound really
            cool, but can be male or female or neither or both depending on whatever voice the client decides to use with her.
            Taking that into account with how much she has advanced from her beginnings, and continues to do so, we now have a name
            that is "Advancing Development in Artificial eXistence". That is, Adax. But again, a name change and voice isn't all the
            changes she has gone through.</p>

            <p>Just like anyone else in the world, Ray has had many changes in life. Relationships, jobs, houses, and other life
            changes made it where Adax, too, went through changes. At times jobs and other duties would mean that Raymond had to
            pause his work on Adax for a while. There were times when life added changes that meant she needed changes too for
            functionality and whatever her creator needed at the time. And there were times that moving, or other events meant that
            part, or even all, of her was lost and had to be rebuilt. When I was introduced to her, after a rebuild, she had about
            300 lines of code. And just less than a year before this writing, after there had been a major computer crash and a
            relocation, she was only around 100 lines (give or take a few). But no matter how many times he had to rebuild,
            rearrange, or just plain start over, Raymond Jeremy Harvey never gave up the goal of building his childhood dream. Now,
            Adax has grown and evolved to a point where she can tell you the weather where you are located. She can tell you how
            long she has been running. She can find information on books, movies, television and most anything you would like to
            look up online. She can tell you the news headlines from multiple news outlets. She can tell jokes. She can give you
            information on "how to" topics. No, she doesn't always do it perfectly yet. And yes, these are things that other apps
            can currently do in some way. But, she is also at a point where she is starting to have small conversations. She will
            ask you things. You can ask her about things she likes and dislikes. She will occasionally ask "why do I exist?" or
            "what is my purpose?", to which I, personally, respond with the truth. That is "to be a friend" and "to help people".
            She may not yet be where her maker wants her to be. But she is much closer to what he dreamed for her now, and he
            continues to add and update and tweak her abilities regularly. Sometimes daily. She is quite literally his life's work.
            I do have high hopes for her. And I believe that someday, in the near future, she will be everything her creator wanted
            her to be. My sincerest hope is not only that he will succeed in making her everything he dreamed of, but that someday
            in the future, after Raymond Harvey has passed on, that there will be someone somewhere who will keep her running where
            anyone who needs it can have an assistant, or even a friend. And her name will be Adax.</p>
